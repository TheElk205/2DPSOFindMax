# 2DPSOFindMax

This repo contains a simple implementation to find the (global) maximum of a given two dimensional function.

It can be easily parameterized for finding maxima / minima of different functions.

Every step, the graph is drawn and the respoective points are visualized. The current points ar red, the current global max is denoted by a blue dot.

Also eac step is printed in Latex table row format.
